This repository contains a research project conducted by me and Martina Del Gaudio on the influence of social factors on a country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The aim of the study was to determine if multiple linear regression could be used to identify the correlation between social factors and economic growth, with the goal of constructing a production function.

# Data Selection and Data Cleaning
Data from nearly 120 countries spanning a 60-year period (1960-2021) were collected, primarily from The World Bank Data and OECD. Explanatory variables were selected to represent various social aspects, such as population variations, unemployment, fertility rate, and education. Data cleaning involved removing missing values and transforming the data using logarithms.

# Cobb-Douglas Production Function using Multiple Linear Regression
A Cobb-Douglas production function was used to model the relationship between GDP, labor force, and capital. By converting the function into a linear model, a regression analysis was performed.

# "Social" Production Function using Multiple Linear Regression
The study extended the regression analysis to include social variables such as net migration, unemployment, secondary education, and male mortality rate. Visualizations and regression analyses were conducted.
